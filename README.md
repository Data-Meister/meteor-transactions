Undo/Redo for Meteor
--------------------

This package is used to give the end user an infinite undo/redo stack, based on transactions. A transaction can be a single action (insert, update or remove) on a single document, or a set of different actions across different documents.

An example app is up at [http://transactions.meteor.com/](http://transactions.meteor.com/).

Documentation coming soon.
